# KNN-example-with-Minkowski-Distance

Use KNN for classification and visualized the influence of different Minkowski distance functions and K value

**Python >= 3.6**

**numpy  >= 1.16.2**

**matplotlib >= 3.1.3**

Using Train_data_Print() to show your train data in 3D and Test_data_Print() for test data

#### The sample data is four Numbers per line, the first three are features, and the fourth is categories (they are represented by 1 , 2 , 3).

If you want to analyze data in four dimensions or more, just modify the parameters

For the test data, the effect of the different Minkowski values and K values is as follows
